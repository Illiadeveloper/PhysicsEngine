# Physics Engine (v0.1)

🚧 **Work in Progress**  
This is an early-stage prototype of a small **Physics Engine** built with **C++** and **OpenGL**.  
At the moment, it's mostly a framework and architectural foundation for the final system.  
Nothing visually interesting yet — just building the core logic.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a minimal but functional 3D physics engine from scratch —  
with basic rendering, transformations, and physical interactions.

---

## 🏗️ Planned Features (v1.0)
- [ ] Transform system (position, rotation, scale)
- [ ] Camera
- [ ] Texture support
- [ ] Collisions
- [ ] Gravity
- [ ] Scene management

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Graphics API:** OpenGL  
- **Build System:** CMake  
- **Architecture:** ECS

---

## 🚀 Current Stage
Version `0.1` — architecture design, initial code structure, and base classes.  
No rendering or physics yet.

---

## 💡 Future Plans
After v1.0:
- Rigidbody simulation  
- Material properties (friction, mass, bounce)
